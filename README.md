# Problem Statement
The decentralized voting problem refers to issues relating to governance and decision making between nodes in blockchain networks. In the world of cryptocurrency transfers, this simply means formulating a way for participants to reach a consensus on how to distribute value without external interference and governance. For example, if an organization operating under a decentralized system needs a specific way to determine a governance change, the organization will use voting among certain members within the network to reach a decision. Defined, the decentralized voting problem is how to create a system where people can vote with weight associated value metrics?
